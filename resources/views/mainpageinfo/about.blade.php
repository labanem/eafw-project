	<?php $companyname = 'eafwconnect' ?>
	<p><span><?php echo $companyname; ?></span> is a site that seeks to establish an effective communication flow within the company by improving the current facilities. This is a project to improve on the consumption of paper and thus play our role in environment conservation. </p>
	<p>As it currently is, we consume a lot of paper per person. Rightly so, because there is no other way around it if we are to keep proper records. We however need to consider the environment every time we take a print out, which is where  <?php echo $companyname ?> comes in. We are dedicated towards ensuring completely paperless transactions where tangible reports or information is not necessary and ensuring the least amount of paper is used in cases where it may deem necessary.</p>
	<p>We hope you enjoy the convenience.</p>
